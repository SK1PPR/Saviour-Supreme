# Saviour-Supreme

A file transfer system made specifically for the IITR - Junta

## Installation

Run the start.sh file included in the repository and the software should open by itself

## Usage

A user can either create a server or join an existing one. There are two levels of access to the server.
1. As a guest user can download any file visible on the server selected path
2. As an admin (requires password) user can download, upload, rename or delete any file on the server

Multi-threading is supported so multiple clients can connect and communicate to the server simultaneously.

For security of the server, features implemented are:

1. Data Encryption
2. Server Logging
3. Rate Limiting
